# AnalogClock
### Hello👋
An analog clock with JavaScript❤️
<hr>
Well, it's very simple<br>
The value of a clock face is equivalent to 360 degrees<br>
So to get the clock we need this formula.<br>

### (hr * 30) + (min/2)
We also need this formula to get minutes.<br>

### (min * 6) + (sec / 10)
The second is clear.<br>
### sec * 6
This whole function is updated every one second.<br>
### That was all!

### Good luck!😍
